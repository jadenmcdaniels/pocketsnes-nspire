PocketSNES on the TI-Nspire CX II: findings
==========================================

What we learned while making PocketSNES faster, 2026-10-02 to 2026-10-04.
Calculator: TI-Nspire CX II, OS 6.40.74 (6.4.0.74), boot2 6.20.7, Ndless
4.5.5 (installer for OS 6.2/6.4). Test game: Super Mario World, World 1 pipe
level, from a save state, Mario standing still.

"Seen" means measured on the calculator; "guess" means not confirmed.


The screen
----------

* Seen: the LCD controller (a PL111 at 0xC0000000) reads 320 lines of 240
  pixels, 16-bit 5:6:5: timing register 2 gives 240 clocks per line, timing
  register 1 gives 320 lines (registers: 0x1425094C, 0x03780D3F, 0x00EF3802,
  control 0x392D). It reads 153,600 bytes per frame. Timing register 0 says
  320 pixels per line, but that's not what the DMA reads.
* Seen: landscape pixel (x, y) belongs at position 239 - y of line x. A frame
  turned that way into a buffer in normal memory shows upright when the LCD
  is pointed at it ("flip": each frame is turned into one of three such
  buffers and the buffer's address is written to the LCD, 0xC0000010).
  PocketSNES now only uses this if the DMA controller fails (below).
* Seen: the OS's own LCD buffer is at 0xA8000000. Memory there turns pixels
  as the CPU writes them: a plain landscape copy into it shows upright. CPU
  reads from it return pixels in the turned (portrait) order. The region is
  mapped write-through cached.
* Seen: Ndless matches its source for this OS. lcd_type() says
  SCR_320x240_565 (is_hww is 0), and lcd_blit is a plain 153,600-byte
  memcpy into 0xA8000000. The picture is right, but writing that memory is
  slow: 4.3 ms per frame at 287 MHz.
* Seen: pointing the LCD at a plain landscape buffer of our own gives a
  sideways, garbled picture.
* Seen: the program's code, static buffers and heap are mapped 1:1
  (virtual = physical) and write-back cached, so the LCD can read the
  program's buffers directly. The stack is the exception.
* Seen: Ndless doesn't put PocketSNES in its compatibility mode: the build
  uses lcd_blit, so genzehn marks it as supporting the CX II screen.
  (Compatibility mode, in Ndless's lcd_compat.c, sends the LCD panel a
  row/column swap over SPI so the LCD shows a plain landscape buffer. That is
  how lr-gpsp-nspire works on the CX II, and it tears.)
* Seen: the DMA controller at 0xBC000000 (a Faraday FTDMAC020, revision
  register 0x00011900, feature register 0x00006303: 6 channels, both bus
  ports, linked lists) copies frames into the OS's LCD buffer, as the OS
  does. At startup channel 0 still holds the OS's last copy: control
  0x00071206 (both ports AHB1, 32-bit, 256-word bursts), source in normal
  memory, destination ending at 0xA8025800. The source and destination
  registers count up and the size register counts down during a copy.
  PocketSNES can copy each frame this way on channel 1 ("dma"), with its
  interrupts masked, from one of two buffers, while the next frame is drawn
  into the other. Since 2026-10-05 that is a setting (Screen output: DMA);
  the default turns only the picture into one of three portrait buffers and
  flips the LCD to it (no tearing).
* Seen: a 320x240 frame copy by DMA takes 12.60 / 4.72 / 3.15 / 3.21 / 3.25 /
  3.58 ms with 1 / 4 / 8 / 16 / 32 / 64-word bursts (256-word, the OS's
  setting, wasn't timed), and 1.93 ms when the source is the on-chip SRAM.
  The LCD buffer limits it: the CPU's own copy into it takes 3.15 ms too.
* Seen: while a DMA copy runs, the CPU is slower: with DMA output the game's
  CPU time rose from 5.7 to 7.0 ms per frame and drawing from 11.9 to 12.4
  ms, which ate most of the 2.4 ms the copy saved (see the table below).


The CPU clock
-------------

* Seen: a timed loop of 80 million cycles measured 287 MHz in one speed test
  run, probably with the calculator plugged in over USB. The CX II is rated
  396 MHz, and the 48-49 fps seen while playing fits 396 MHz (34.8 fps x
  396 / 287 = 48).
* Reported (zephray, NoverII): the CPU runs at 288 MHz with USB connected
  and 396 MHz without, so run speed tests unplugged and check the "cpu ...
  MHz" in each results header. The clock is 12 MHz times a multiplier in
  bits 24-29 of 0x90140030 (x33 = 396, x24 = 288); the bus runs at half the
  CPU clock and memory goes up with it. NoverII's author found x41 (492 MHz)
  the highest safe setting; it varies by unit. Not tried here.
* Seen: the 0x900C0000 timer runs at 32768 Hz on the CX II (checked against
  the real-time clock).


Where the time goes
-------------------

Speed test at 287 MHz, every frame drawn (ms per frame):

| Part | Run the game | Draw | Show (lcd_blit) | Total | fps |
|------|-------------:|-----:|----------------:|------:|----:|
| Every frame drawn | 7.5 | 16.2 | 4.8 | 28.5 | 34.8 |
| Nothing drawn | 7.6 | 0 | 0 | 7.6 | 130 |

At 396 MHz that's roughly 5.4 + 11.7 + 3.7 = 20.8 ms, about 48 fps. 60 fps
leaves 16.7 ms per frame, so running and drawing alone (about 17 ms) are
already just over.

Copying one 320x240 frame at 287 MHz: normal memory to normal memory
2.9 ms, into 0xA8000000 4.3 ms, out of 0xA8000000 1.1 ms. Normal memory is
slow enough that turning a frame into a flip buffer costs nearly as much as
lcd_blit, which is why flipping only gained about 1 fps.

Seen while playing SMW with frameskip off:

| Build | fps |
|-------|----:|
| Before (lcd_blit, two copies per frame) | 40 |
| Drawing straight into the frame, one lcd_blit, -O3 | 48 |
| Flip | 49 |

Speed test at 395 MHz with the DMA build, every frame drawn, no speed limit
(ms per frame):

| Output | Run the game | Draw | Show | fps |
|--------|-------------:|-----:|-----:|----:|
| dma | 7.0 | 12.4 | 0.3 | 50.3 |
| flip | 5.7 | 11.9 | 2.7 | 48.7 |
| lcd_blit | 5.7 | 11.9 | 3.5 | 47.0 |

Compiler settings: -O3 beat -O2 and -Os. Speed test, automatic frameskip,
first part only, probably at 396 MHz: running the game took 5.8 / 6.1 / 6.2
ms per frame and drawing 11.9 / 12.2 / 13.3 ms per drawn frame (-O3 / -O2 /
-Os). -O3 is the default now.

Frameskip: automatic frameskip kept the game at full speed (59.9 game fps)
at 287 MHz. Manual frameskip 1 (30/30) only managed 54 game fps there.


Memory
------

* Seen: the CPU (id 0x41069265, cache type 0x1D112152) has a 16 KB
  instruction cache and an 8 KB data cache, and no TCM (TCM status 0).
* Seen: the program runs in SVC mode with IRQs off (cpsr 0x20000093).
* Seen: the on-chip SRAM at 0xA4000000 (256 KB) is mapped 1:1,
  write-through cached (descriptor 0xA4000C1A, like the LCD buffer's). None
  of it changed in 2 seconds or while a file was written, and writing to it
  with interrupts off and putting it back did no harm.
* Seen: its first bytes are the CPU's exception vectors (ldr pc, [pc, #0x18]
  x 8, then the handler addresses: the OS at 0x1042xxxx, Ndless's system
  call and data abort handlers at 0x13A1xxxx, IRQ to a stub at 0x40). After
  them come the OS's interrupt entry stub and its sleep code (cleans the
  cache, turns the MMU off). Wiping them gives a black screen and a freeze
  at the next system call; the calculator needs a reset. So the first 16 KB
  must be left alone. The rest is the boot loader's leftovers (boot2
  5.0.0.42: its log, e.g. "Clocks: CPU = 396 MHz AHB = 198 MHz APB = 99
  MHz", and its Nucleus kernel's data).
* Seen: speeds drawing 8x8 tiles the way the renderer does (CPU cycles per
  pixel, 395 MHz):

| | Normal memory | On-chip SRAM |
|---|---:|---:|
| 16-bit stores | 6.1 | 2.0 |
| read the line first, then 16-bit stores | 10.0 | 3.2 |
| 32-bit stores (2 pixels) | 3.0 | 1.0 |
| 32-bit reads (2 pixels) | 7.4 | 1.8 |
| memset (bursts) | 3.1 | 1.4 |

  Writes that miss the cache don't stall much: a whole screen of 16-bit
  stores costs 0.9 ms, and reading each line first only slows it down. Reads
  that miss are what's slow (a cache line from normal memory costs about
  120 cycles), and the SRAM is about 4 times faster for them.

Super Mario World
-----------------

* Seen: the main screen has BG1 (the level), BG3 (the status bar) and the
  sprites. The sub screen has BG2 (the hills), which shows through the
  backdrop with color math (add, backdrop only).
  Registers: $212C = 0x15, $212D = 0x02, $2130 = 0x02, $2131 = 0x20.
  So a "transparency off" mode would make the hills disappear.
* Seen: this Snes9x 1.43 port draws nothing at all with
  Settings.Transparency off: the non-transparency branch of S9xUpdateScreen
  is empty.
* Seen: each frame draws about 2,950 8x8 tiles (DrawTile16), and the screen
  is drawn in two batches (lines 0-36, the status bar, then 37-223). Drawing
  is the biggest cost.


Gotchas
-------

* The calculator only accepts files ending in .tns over USB ("Invalid
  input" otherwise). Files the program writes for reading on the PC
  (pocketsnes_results.txt.tns, pocketsnes_diag.txt.tns,
  pocketsnes_perf.txt.tns) end in .tns for that reason.
* Interlaced Mode 5 draws up to twice the lines, so the screen buffer has
  272 spare lines below the picture.
* The renderer keeps the distance between its buffers in a 32-bit int.
  Heap buffers on a 64-bit PC overflow it, so the render buffers are static.
* Firebird (the emulator) isn't set up: it needs files dumped from the
  calculator, and its speed wouldn't match the real thing anyway.


Tools
-----

* `make -f Makefile.nspire BENCH=1 BUILD=build/bench TARGET=pocketsnes_speedtest_O3`
  builds a speed test that runs on its own. It plays Super Mario World from
  its newest save state for 5 seconds, writes pocketsnes_diag.txt.tns
  (clock, LCD registers, memory mapping, copy speeds), runs the speed test,
  appends the results to pocketsnes_results.txt.tns, and closes.
* `~/nspire/build/tools/nspire-link`: info, ls, mkdir, put [-f], get, rm,
  shot over USB.
* The installed Ndless can be read from /ndless/ndless_resources.tns: a PRG
  loader followed by a Zehn binary at offset 0x1ec. Code starts after the
  header, relocations, flags and extra data.


Ideas not tried yet
-------------------

* Tried and switched off (SRAM_RENDERING in platform_nspire.cpp): the game
  screen and depth buffer in the on-chip SRAM (saved at start, put back at
  exit), frames copied to the LCD from there, the renderer waiting for the
  copy to pass the lines it draws. The first try wiped the exception vectors
  (above). The second left the first 16 KB alone and still gave a black
  screen and a freeze, in both the game and the speed test; the cause isn't
  known. The speed test now checks, without writing to the SRAM, whether the
  DMA controller can read it at all.
* Seen (user): Yoshi's Island (Super FX) glitches in the top rows of the
  picture, in the old build too, so it comes from the emulator core.

* Done 2026-10-05: only the 256x224 picture is turned; 8-word DMA bursts;
  DrawTile16 in faster C (ARM assembly could still go further).
* Profile-guided optimization (compile, record a run, compile again using
  the recording).
* The 6 ms of game emulation (the 65c816 core) is now close to the 7 ms
  of drawing.

Drawing (2026-10-05)
--------------------

* Seen (PC, gprof, SMW standing in the pipe level): per frame the renderer
  makes about 2,930 tile calls (2,690 for the backgrounds, 240 for sprite
  lines) and 115 clipped ones. The biggest costs were the tile pixel loop
  and the backdrop pass: SMW's backdrop is black with the sub screen (the
  hills) added, so after drawing, every pixel of every line was checked
  again and the hills or the fixed colour (the sky) copied in.
* Seen (ARM assembly, -O3): through WRITE_4PIXELS16 GCC reloaded GFX.Z1 and
  GFX.Z2 after every pixel and GFX.S and GFX.DB every 4 pixels, because the
  code is built with -fno-strict-aliasing and a byte store could change
  them: 14 instructions and two branches per pixel drawn. DrawTile16 and
  DrawClippedTile16 now keep them in local variables and skip transparent
  tile lines in one test: 9 instructions, no branch, per pixel drawn.
* The SMW backdrop case (no colour windows, black backdrop, sub screen added)
  is now done before the main screen is drawn: the sub screen line is filled
  with the fixed colour, drawn, and copied under the main screen. Same
  pixels, no per-pixel pass.
* Tried and dropped: band drawing (8 lines at a time into small buffers that
  fit the data cache, each band turned straight into a portrait buffer).
  Seen (speed test, SMW, 395 MHz, ms per frame, every frame drawn):

| | Run the game | Draw | Show | fps |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Before (DMA) | 6.9 | 12.1 | 0.3 | 51.1 |
| New tile code, bands of 8 lines | 6.9 | 12.0 | 0.5 | 51.4 |
| ... bands of 4 / 16 lines | 6.9 | 13.5 / 12.5 | 0.5 | 47.4 / 50.1 |
| New tile code, whole frames, DMA | 7.5 | 9.0 | 0.3 | 58.8 |
| New tile code, whole frames, flip | 6.3 | 9.0 | 2.7 | 55.0 |

  So the tile code and the backdrop shortcut took drawing from 12.1 to 9.0
  ms, and the bands (tiles cut in two at band edges, per-band setup,
  turning) cost more than the cache saved. Whole frames are drawn again;
  only the 256x224 picture and the text over it are turned (in 8-line
  strips, see rotate_block) into the portrait buffer shown next, and the
  whole 320x240 frame only when that buffer is out of date. Not measured on
  the calculator yet (pocketsnes_speedtest_turn.tns).
* When nothing on the main screen has colour maths (SMW), the sub screen is
  now drawn straight into the main screen's buffer: no line copy at all.
* GCC writes 4 consecutive word stores as 4 STRs; the turning code uses one
  STM (inline asm, registers r4-r7) so the 16 bytes go out as one burst.
* All of this draws exactly the same pixels as the original renderer:
  tests/render_compare.sh plays each ROM with the reference build
  (pocketsnes-host-ref, the renderer before these changes) and the current
  one and compares a screenshot every 2 to 4 frames (12 test ROMs and SMW,
  plus Chrono Trigger, Zelda ALttP and Yoshi's Island from the calculator,
  in ~/nspire/build/testroms/calc). A coverage build showed every new path
  is exercised.
* Seen (PC only): the original PC build crashed in Chrono Trigger's Mode 7
  intro (DrawBGMode7Background16Add): GFX.DepthDelta is an unsigned 32-bit
  distance from the main to the sub depth buffer, and the static buffers
  happened to be in the other order, which a 64-bit pointer doesn't wrap.
  On the calculator it wraps and works. The PC build now keeps the buffers
  in order.
* Seen: pocketsnes_results.txt.tns and pocketsnes_diag.txt.tns came back
  garbled now and then (a block repeated, binary bytes at the start, the end
  cut off mid-line), always in files that were appended to ("a") over many
  runs. Both are now written as new files each run.
* Seen (calculator, pocketsnes_new.tns's menu speed test, SMW, cpu 432 MHz):
  normal play 59.9 fps (game 5.5, draw 6.6, show 1.7 ms); no speed limit
  71.6 fps (DMA output 73.1, whole-frame flip 67.7); nothing drawn 174.2.
  The turn speed test at 395 MHz: 65.7 / 67.1 / 62.1.
* Seen (USB, nspire-link): files of exactly 479 bytes wouldn't transfer in
  either direction. 479 bytes plus the CX II protocol's headers is one
  512-byte USB packet: the calculator doesn't end such a message with an
  empty packet, so libnspire's read ran on into the next one (and checked
  the checksum over the wrong length), and libnspire didn't send one after
  its own 512-byte messages either. Fixed in
  ~/nspire/build/tools/libnspire/src/cx2.cpp (readPacket, writePacket; the
  original is cx2.cpp.orig). nspire-link also got "cp REMOTE NEWREMOTE".

Where things stand (2026-10-05)
-------------------------------

* Seen (speed test, SMW pipe level, 396 MHz, ms per frame): game 6.0,
  drawing 7.2, showing 1.8 (turned picture); no speed limit 65.7 fps (DMA
  output 67.1, whole-frame flip 62.1); normal play holds 60. Before the
  drawing work: 51.1 fps, drawing 12.1 ms.
* Seen, not explained: the calculator's measured clock went 395 -> 432 ->
  475 MHz across runs without anyone overclocking it, and the frame rates
  rose by the same amount (so it really ran faster). One later run, with
  USB plugged in, read 287 MHz (clock register x24). The speed test now
  prints the clock register's multiplier to help find out.
* CPU speed setting (432/456/480 MHz, the NoverII way: multiplier in bits
  24-29 of 0x90140030, bit 0 set, bit 4 cleared, 1 ms wait with interrupts
  off): not confirmed on the calculator. The user thinks it doesn't work;
  the one run on record didn't show it, but the setting may have been
  turned on after that run. To check: run the menu speed test with it on
  and look for "clock register x40" in the results.
* NoverII also has a bus divider (0x90140020 bits 20-23) and a bit in
  0x90140810 (bit 4, set when that divider isn't 0); PocketSNES doesn't
  touch them.
* nspire-link (libnspire, CX II): the calculator streams messages back to
  back without ending a 512-byte one with an empty USB packet. Reading one
  USB packet first and then exactly the rest of a message overflows
  (LIBUSB_ERROR_OVERFLOW) on every message over 512 bytes, so the read
  keeps libnspire's single long read; the fix is to check the checksum
  over the message's own length and drop anything read past it. Writes add
  the empty packet after a message that fills whole USB packets. Checked
  with files of 478 to 40,000 bytes both ways.
