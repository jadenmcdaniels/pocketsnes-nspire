PocketSNES for TI-Nspire
========================

Play Super Nintendo games on a TI-Nspire CX or CX II calculator.

This is gameblabla's PocketSNES port of Snes9x 1.43, with a new front end:
a game list you can sort, a menu like gpSP's, 999 save state slots per game,
settings per game, smooth tear-free drawing on the CX II, and an overclock
setting with a test that finds your calculator's highest safe speed.

There's no sound, because the calculator has no speaker.

Getting started
---------------

You need a TI-Nspire with a colour screen (CX or CX II) and
[Ndless](https://ndless.me).

1. **Install Ndless** for your OS version (see [ndless.me](https://ndless.me)).
   On a CX II, Ndless has to be switched on again after every reset: just
   open the Ndless installer document.
2. **Copy `pocketsnes.tns` to the calculator**, into any folder (a folder
   called `snes` works well). Use TI-Nspire Computer Link, the Student
   Software, TiLP, or any other transfer tool. Keep the name
   `pocketsnes.tns`, so ROMs can open in it straight from the documents.
3. **Copy your ROMs over and add `.tns` to their names.** The calculator only
   accepts `.tns` files, so `Super Mario World.sfc` becomes
   `Super Mario World.sfc.tns`. Any folder works.
4. **Open `pocketsnes.tns`.** The first time, a welcome screen shows the
   keys. Then the game list opens: pick a game and press **enter**, or press
   the **number** next to it.
5. That's it. After the first run, you can also open a ROM straight from the
   calculator's documents.

When you leave a game with **Q** (or *Exit PocketSNES* in the menu),
PocketSNES saves where you were, and the game carries on from there next
time.


Controls

### In a game

| SNES button    | Calculator key                              |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| D-pad          | arrows (touchpad), or 8 4 6 5               |
| A / B          | ctrl / shift                                |
| X / Y          | var / del                                   |
| L / R          | tab / menu                                  |
| Start / Select | enter / minus (−)                           |

| Hotkey       | Key  | What it does                                        |
|--------------|------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Menu         | esc  | opens the menu (the game waits)                     |
| Quit         | Q    | leaves the game, saving your place first            |
| Fast forward | F    | on/off: runs as fast as it can                      |
| Save state   | S    | saves a state (each save gets a new slot)           |
| Load state   | L    | loads the selected slot                             |

More hotkeys (load newest, next/previous slot, FPS counter, restart) are
there but have no key until you give them one. Every key can be changed in
the menu under *SNES buttons* and *Hotkeys*. Each action takes two keys, and
a key can be a combination (hold one key and press another). *Controls &
about* in the menu always shows your keys as they are now.

### In menus

| Key                   | Does                          |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| arrows, or 8 5 4 6    | move                          |
| left / right          | change a setting              |
| enter (or click)      | select                        |
| esc                   | back                          |

### In the game list

| Key            | Does                                                   |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1–9, 0         | start that game (the number is shown next to it)       |
| arrows         | move; left/right turn a page                           |
| enter          | start the game, or open a folder                       |
| tab            | pick up the game to move it (see below)                |
| menu           | settings for that game (or for all games, on a folder) |
| esc            | quit PocketSNES                                        |

In the game list the number keys start games, so moving is done with the
arrows there.


The game list
-------------

The list shows the folder PocketSNES was last in. Folders come first, then
your games. The first ten games have a number next to them: press it to
start that game right away.

**Putting your games in your own order:** press **tab** on a game (or pick
*Move in the list* from its menu). The game gets a gold frame. Move it with
up/down (left/right jump a page), then press **enter** to put it there, or
**esc** to put it back where it was. Each folder remembers its order. To go
back to alphabetical, press **menu** on a game and pick *Sort the list A to
Z*.

The game's menu (the **menu** key) can also start it without loading a
state (handy if a state is broken) and change its settings.


Saving
------

There are two kinds of saves, and both happen without you thinking about
them much:

* **In-game saves** are the game's own saves, like on a real SNES cartridge.
  PocketSNES writes them to the calculator a couple of seconds after the
  game saves.
* **Save states** freeze the whole game at any moment. **S** saves one, **L**
  loads one, and leaving a game saves one so you can carry on next time.
  Each game has 999 slots. Every save goes to a new slot, so an old save is
  never overwritten. A state takes a few dozen KB.

You can pick a slot in the menu (*Save state* / *Load state*, left/right
choose the slot). Everything a game saves goes in a `.pocketsnes` folder
next to the ROM.


Speed and overclocking
----------------------

On a CX II at its normal 396 MHz, Super Mario World runs at a full 60 frames
per second with every frame drawn. Games with extra chips (Super FX like
Yoshi's Island and Star Fox, or SA-1) are much heavier.

To help a slow game:

* **Keep frameskip on automatic** (the default). The game always runs at
  full speed and only skips drawing a frame when it has to.
* **Turn on the FPS counter** (menu → *Graphics & speed*) to see how it's
  doing: 60/60 is perfect.
* **Unplug the USB cable.** While it's plugged in, the calculator runs at
  288 MHz instead of 396.
* **Overclock** (CX II only), see below.

### Overclocking

*CPU speed* in *Graphics & speed* runs games faster than the calculator's
normal 396 MHz, in steps of 12 MHz up to 504 MHz. Menus and saving always
run at normal speed.

How far a calculator can go differs from one to the next. Most manage about
430 to 490 MHz. The limit is usually the memory: it speeds up together with
the CPU, but keeps the timings it was set up with for normal speed. Go too
far and you'll see glitches, then the calculator freezes and needs a reset.
That doesn't harm it (nothing runs at a higher voltage, and every restart
goes back to normal speed), but a speed that *sometimes* glitches can
quietly corrupt the game in memory, and that can end up in a save state.

So **run the overclock test once** to find your calculator's safe speed:

1. Menu → *Graphics & speed* → *Overclock test*. Unplug USB first.
2. It tries 408, 420, 432 MHz and so on. At each speed it checks the memory
   and the CPU for 16 seconds, and stops at the first speed that makes an
   error. A full run takes 1 to 2 minutes; esc stops it.
3. If the calculator freezes during the test, that's fine: reset it, open
   Ndless again and start PocketSNES. It knows the test was running and
   keeps the highest speed that passed.
4. Then set *CPU speed* to **highest tested**. The menu shows the result,
   e.g. *highest tested (444 MHz)*.

When a game starts at a raised speed it says what it got ("CPU 444 MHz").
If a speed ever freezes a game, PocketSNES puts *CPU speed* back to normal
at the next start and tells you. If a game glitches at the tested speed on a
hot day or a low battery, pick one step lower.


Troubleshooting
---------------

* **My ROM isn't in the list.** Its name has to end in `.tns`
  (`game.sfc.tns`). Use *Up a folder* at the top of the list to get to other
  folders.
* **"Couldn't load ..."** The file isn't a SNES ROM, it's damaged, or it's
  too big for the free memory.
* **A game is slow.** Keep frameskip on automatic, unplug USB, look at the
  FPS counter, and try overclocking.
* **The calculator froze.** Press the reset button on the back with a paper
  clip, then open the Ndless installer again. If it froze at a raised CPU
  speed, PocketSNES goes back to normal speed by itself.
* **A save state is broken.** In the game list, press **menu** on the game
  and choose *Play without a state*.
* **I want the default settings back.** Delete `pocketsnes.cfg.tns` next to
  `pocketsnes.tns`.
* **Opening a ROM from the documents doesn't start PocketSNES.** The program
  has to be called `pocketsnes.tns` and must have run once.

*Everything below is reference. You don't need it to play.*


Every menu setting
------------------

Press **esc** in a game for the menu, or **menu** in the game list. Settings
can be for **all games** or for **one game only**: *Settings for* and *Keys
for* in the menu switch between the two. A game's own settings are used
whenever that game runs.

### Graphics & speed

| Setting | Choices (default first) | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Frameskip | **automatic**, manual, off | Automatic skips drawing only when the game falls behind, so the game keeps full speed. Manual draws 1 frame in every N+1. Off draws every frame; the game slows down if drawing can't keep up. |
| Frames to skip | **5** (0–9) | Automatic: the most frames skipped in a row. Manual: N. |
| FPS counter | **off**, on, detailed | Frames drawn per second over the most there can be: 60/60 is full speed. Detailed adds how long each part of a frame takes and logs it to `pocketsnes_perf.txt.tns`. |
| Screen output (CX II) | **no tearing**, DMA | No tearing shows every frame whole. DMA is a little faster but can show a split line when the picture scrolls fast. |
| CPU speed (CX II) | **normal**, highest tested, 408 … 504 MHz | Overclocks while a game runs. See [Overclocking](#overclocking). |
| Overclock test (CX II) | | Finds the highest speed that runs without errors. The result shows next to it. |
| Run speed test | | In a game only: plays from where you are for about 35 seconds in five ways and shows the frame rates. Results also go to `pocketsnes_results.txt.tns`. |

### Saving

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Auto-increment slot | on | Every save goes to a new slot, so nothing is overwritten. Off: saves go to the selected slot. |
| Save when leaving | on | Quitting, or going back to the game list, saves a state first. |
| Load newest on start | on | Games start from their newest state. *Play without a state* in the game list skips it once. |
| Write in-game saves | automatic | When the game's own save is written to the calculator: a couple of seconds after the game saves, or only on exit. |

### SNES buttons and Hotkeys

Left/right pick key 1 or key 2, enter sets it (press a key, or hold one key
and press another for a combination), del clears it. *Reset to defaults* is
at the bottom. The arrows always work as the d-pad.

### The rest

* **In a game:** *Resume game*, *Save state* / *Load state* (left/right pick
  the slot, hold to go faster), *Restart game*, *Load another game*,
  *Controls & about*, *Exit PocketSNES*.
* **In the game list, on a game:** *Play*, *Play without a state*, *Move in
  the list*, *Sort the list A to Z*, and the game's settings.


Files
-----

Next to each ROM, in a `.pocketsnes` folder:

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `game.sfc.srm.tns` | the in-game save |
| `game.sfc.sv001.tns` … `game.sfc.sv999.tns` | save states (compressed) |
| `game.sfc.cfg.tns` | the game's own settings or keys, if it has any |
| `game_order.txt.tns` | the order of the folder's games, once you've moved one |

Next to `pocketsnes.tns`:

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `pocketsnes.cfg.tns` | settings and keys for all games, and the overclock test's result (delete it to start fresh) |
| `pocketsnes_overclock.txt.tns` | what the overclock test found at each speed |
| `pocketsnes_results.txt.tns` | the last speed test's results |
| `pocketsnes_perf.txt.tns` | the detailed FPS log, if you turned it on |
| `pocketsnes_clock.tns` | only there while a game runs overclocked; if it's still there at the next start, that speed froze the calculator |
| `pocketsnes_octest.tns` | only there while the overclock test runs, for the same reason |


What runs
---------

* Most SNES games run, including ones with DSP-1, DSP-2, Super FX, SA-1,
  C4, OBC1 and Seta chips (the heavy ones slowly).
* **S-DD1 and SPC7110 games don't run**: Star Ocean and Street Fighter Alpha
  2 (S-DD1), Far East of Eden Zero and Momotarou Dentetsu Happy (SPC7110).
* There's no sound emulation at all, which also saves time.
* Yoshi's Island shows glitches in the top rows of the picture. That comes
  from the emulator core; the original port has them too.
* ROMs can be up to 8 MB, if the calculator has the memory free.
* Calculators without a colour screen aren't supported.


How it got faster
-----------------

Measured on a CX II at 396 MHz with Super Mario World, every frame drawn:

| Version | Frames per second |
|---|---:|
| The original port (lcd_blit, two copies of each frame) | 40 |
| The game drawn straight into the frame, -O3 | 48 |
| Frames handed to the LCD instead of copied ("flip") | 49 |
| Frames copied by the DMA chip | 50 (no speed limit) |
| Faster tile drawing, and a shortcut for SMW's backdrop | 59 (no speed limit) |
| Only the 256×224 picture turned for the portrait LCD, tear-free (now) | 66–68 (no speed limit) |

Where a frame's time went, before and now (ms, no speed limit): running the
game 5.7 → 6.0, drawing 11.9 → 7.2, getting it on screen 2.7 → 1.8.

* **Drawing straight into the frame.** The original drew into one buffer,
  copied it to another, and then had Ndless's `lcd_blit` copy it again.
* **The CX II's screen is portrait.** Its LCD reads 320 lines of 240 pixels,
  so a landscape frame has to be turned. `lcd_blit` does that through the
  OS's special LCD memory, which is slow (4 ms a frame). PocketSNES turns
  only the SNES picture (and the text over it) into one of three buffers of
  its own and points the LCD at it. The LCD only switches buffers between
  refreshes, so there's no tearing.
* **DMA output** (optional): the calculator's DMA chip copies frames into
  the OS's LCD memory while the next frame is drawn.
* **Tile drawing** keeps the renderer's state in registers instead of
  reloading it for every pixel (14 → 9 instructions per pixel).
* **Backdrop shortcut**: games like Super Mario World put their background
  on the sub screen with colour maths over a black backdrop; that's now
  drawn directly instead of being fixed up pixel by pixel afterwards.
* **Timer fix**: the frame timer used to be "calibrated" while ROMs loaded,
  which could make games run 5–20% too slow while the counter still said 60.

Everything draws exactly the same pixels as the original renderer
(`tests/render_compare.sh` checks that on 16 games and demos). The full
measurements are in [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md).


For developers
--------------

### Building

The calculator build needs the [Ndless SDK](https://github.com/ndless-nspire/Ndless)
toolchain on PATH (`nspire-gcc`, `nspire-g++`, `nspire-ld`, `genzehn`,
`make-prg`):

    make -f Makefile.nspire              # makes pocketsnes.tns
    make -C tools/clocktest              # the stand-alone clock switch test

Variants each need their own `BUILD` folder, because make doesn't notice
changed flags:

    make -f Makefile.nspire OPT_LEVEL=-O2 BUILD=build/o2
    make -f Makefile.nspire BENCH=1 BUILD_NAME=mine BUILD=build/bench TARGET=pocketsnes_speedtest

`BENCH=1` makes a build that plays `Super Mario World (USA).sfc.tns` (next to
it) from its newest state, writes a hardware report
(`pocketsnes_diag.txt.tns`: clock, timer, LCD, DMA, memory), runs the speed
test and closes.

The PC test build needs g++ and zlib (and SDL2's headers for a window):

    make                                 # makes ./pocketsnes-host
    ./pocketsnes-host                    # the game list, in a window
    tests/run.sh                         # the test suite (54 checks)
    make unit-tests                      # tile drawing, frame turning, settings

[TESTING.md](TESTING.md) explains the PC build, its script mode and the
tests.

### Source layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|

### How it works

**A frame.** The core draws the 256×224 picture straight into a 320×240
RGB565 buffer (with spare lines around it, because the renderer writes
whole 8×8 tiles). On a CX II the front end then turns the picture into one
of three portrait buffers and writes that buffer's address to the LCD
controller (a PL111 at 0xC0000000). With DMA output, the DMA controller (an
FTDMAC020 at 0xBC000000) copies the landscape frame to the OS's LCD memory
at 0xA8000000 instead. Other calculators use Ndless's `lcd_blit`.

**Timing.** The first SP804 timer (0x900C0000) runs free at 32768 Hz.
`emu.cpp` paces frames in 16.16 fixed-point ticks and decides for each frame
whether to draw it. Interrupts stay off while PocketSNES runs.

**CPU speed.** The CX II's power controller (0x90140000) holds the clock
multiplier in bits 24–29 of 0x90140030 (12 MHz × 33 = 396 MHz), but writing
the register does nothing by itself. PocketSNES switches the way the OS does
(its code lives in the on-chip SRAM): normal memory goes into self-refresh,
and for each step of the multiplier the register is written, the switch is
started through register 0x20, and the CPU waits for the power controller's
interrupt. That code runs from the SRAM (`clock_switch_nspire.S`), with the
LCD reading the OS's on-chip buffer meanwhile. After each switch, a loop of
known length is timed against the 32 kHz timer to check the clock really
changed. Marker files catch freezes. Details in FINDINGS.md.

**The overclock test** fills a buffer of up to 8 MB (far bigger than the
8 KB data cache) with patterns, reads them back and inverts them, over and
over, and checks a CPU calculation against its result at normal speed. Two
rounds of 8 seconds per speed, each after its own clock switch.

**Settings file.** `name=value` lines (`config_version=3`, `frameskip_type`,
`cpu_speed`, `highest_tested_mhz`, … `key_a=122`, `key_a_2=121+20` for
shift+3). Key numbers are lr-gpsp-nspire's. A game's own file adds
`own_settings=1` / `own_keys=1`. Unknown lines are ignored, so older and
newer builds can share the file; version 2 files' CPU speeds are converted.

**Save states** are Snes9x snapshots compressed with zlib.


Future steps
------------

Ideas that haven't been done yet, roughly from most to least promising:

* **Tile drawing in ARM assembly.** Drawing is still the biggest part of a
  frame. snes9x2002 has an ARM assembly tile renderer that could be ported.
* **Profile-guided optimisation**: compile, record a run, compile again
  using the recording.
* **Rendering into the on-chip SRAM**, which is several times faster than
  normal memory for reads. Two earlier tries froze the calculator; it later
  turned out the MMU's page table lives in the SRAM at 0xA4004000, which
  those tries overwrote, so a retry that leaves the first 32 KB alone might
  work.
* **A higher overclock ceiling.** The memory keeps its normal-speed timings
  when overclocked, which is probably what limits most calculators. Working
  out the memory controller's timing registers could let calculators go
  further.
* **S-DD1 and SPC7110 support** (Star Ocean, Street Fighter Alpha 2, Far East
  of Eden Zero).
* **Yoshi's Island's top-row glitches** in the core's Super FX code.
